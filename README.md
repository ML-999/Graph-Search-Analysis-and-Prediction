# Graph Search Analysis and Prediction
## Task Introduction  
Given: A virtual robot arm on table, we can set a start- and goal configuration of the robot arm as well as some obstacles, an algorithm based on A* is used to find a valid path from the start configurantion to the goal configuration.
My task: Optimize this path searching by reducing the times of collision checking, so that it finds the path faster
